<h2>About</h2>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
  A simple breakout game with a top-10 leaderboard that is saved on a mysql database.
  The game is started by pressing a button and can be restarted as many times as wanted
  with the button. The ball spawn position is randomized which makes the game nonrepetitive.
  There's a timer and the results can be saved after winning by inputting a name and pressing submit.
  <br>I created two versions of this project one with JavaScript (node.js & React) and one with PHP.
